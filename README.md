# UrbanNa

*** Our Goal ***

UrbanNa aims to simplify and accelerate the process of reporting and resolving urban infrastructure
issues by creating a centralized platform where citizens can easily document problems while providing
officials with the data needed to make informed decisions about resource allocation. Specifically, the
system will help users identify and report issues like potholes, broken streetlights, fallen trees, and other
urban infrastructure problems, track the status of their reports, and visualize problem patterns across their
community.

*** Technical Approach ***
1. Frontend: A cross-platform framework (e.g., Flutter, React Native) in order to reach more users
2. Backend: Node.js with Express
3. Database: A NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB)
4. Machine Learning: Simple ML model to validate images according to severity
